-----------------
Building on Linux
-----------------

By default, everything is compiled for the current computer,
but cross-compilation is available. Currently armhf and
aarch64 are supported if the required tools are available.

There are three build modes you can choose from:

 - DEVELOPMENT (default)
 
 Development mode will put all dependencies under the 
 build directory by default, and leave the core targets
 in their respective output directories. Useful when an
 IDE needs a full include path or to build dependencies 
 into a binary archive. By default, find dependencies 
 in the "devtree-<ARCH>" subdirectory.
 
 - PACKAGE
 
 Package mode will build .deb packages for each target -
 and set /opt/swarmio as the install prefix. Find the packages
 under the "packages" subdirectory.
 
 - INSTALL
 
 Install will install all outputs onto the local machine,
 by default under /opt/swarmio.
 

To build, create a new directory outside the source tree, 
and issue the following commands inside it:

 cmake <PATH TO SOURCE> [optional parameters]
 cmake --build .
 
Optional parameters:
 -DSWARMIO_TARGET_ARCHITECTURE=<ARCH> (armhf or aarch64)
 -DSWARMIO_BUILD_MODE=<MODE> (DEVELOPMENT, PACKAGE or INSTALL)
 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<PATH>

Building on Windows
-------------------

On Windows, only DEVELOPMENT mode is supported, and all
executables will be copied into the "devtree-<ARCH>/bin"
since DLL loading won't work otherwise. 

To build, create a new directory outside the source tree, 
and issue the following commands inside it:

 cmake <PATH TO SOURCE> [optional parameters]
 cmake --build .
 
Optional parameters:
 -DSWARMIO_TARGET_ARCHITECTURE=<ARCH> (x86 or x64)
 -DSWARMIO_HOST_ARCHITECTURE=<ARCH> (x86 or x64)
 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<PATH>
 
(Setting the host architecture can be used to run either the
x86 or x64 executable of the MSVC compiler, and has no other 
effect on the output.)
